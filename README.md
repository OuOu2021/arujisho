## Warnings
- Dictionaries can NOT be imported dynamically. They are built into the app itself. One can build the dictionary database and compile the app himself if needed.
- This app might NOT be actively developed in the future. While bug fixes will always be deployed ASAP. 

## Features
- Reasonable word ranking and search result sorting system based on robust statistic and Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution
- Automatic dealing Kanji variants according to Unihan and Japanese orthographic documents
- Incremental search with regex support
- Merging different written forms of a single word
- Fixing possible errors in dictionary data according to other dictionaries data
- Cross references by morphological analysis thanks to sudachi.rs
- Pronouncing audio via JapanesePod101 and Forvo
- Icon generated by AI using "icon of a japanese dictionary in modern art" as prompt
- Deep Link: `arujisho://?search=` can open this app from other apps like [anki](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/)
- Material 3 design & dark mode support
